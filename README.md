Units tests for the Epitech project Wolf3d

To use this autograder, create the directory src/, place your sources inside, then type ./autograder.sh to launch it.
According to the subject, you don't have to use any include. The compilation command is a pure copy paste from the subject. If you can't compile, read the subject again because the official autograder will shall not compile either.

Feel free to improve it and add some tests !
