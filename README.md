# Wolf3d Autograder

Units tests for the Epitech project Wolf3d

To use this autograder, create directories src/ and include/, place your sources inside, then type ./autograder.sh to launch it. The compilation command is a pure copy paste from the subject. If you can't compile, read the subject again because the official autograder will shall not compile either.

For the moment, maybe the draw_line tests could fail because there is many ways to draw correctly a line and the autograder don't handle all of them. If you have a 100% working draw_line, please send me a mail on my Epitech adress with an official autograder log saying that your draw_line is working and join your code inside. Your function will never be publically publish but only complied in the lib used to test all functions. Also, your name will be added in this readme in a section to thanks all developpers helping in this project.

If you have any issues or questions, you can send me an email on my Epitech adress.
